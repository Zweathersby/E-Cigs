# E-CigsUSC

## Authors
Application developed by: Zack Weathersby

## Purpose
Intended for use in doctors offices by patients who are smokers for the doctor to get a better understanding of their patients need before the appointment even begins.

The patients will first review information regarding their smoking habits, and, depending on their choice, information about e-cigarettes as well.

Patients will then complete a survey which is customized by their doctors office. The doctor will log in to their administrator account where they can edit the questions asked in the survey to include a variety of multiple choice, short answer, slider, and true/false questions.

The patients response are grouped by patient names and are able to be viewed in the doctor's administrator account.
